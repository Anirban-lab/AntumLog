# Abstract
The present invention relates to new centralized ledger technology with centralized validation process. It offers a single platform for all categories of realtime transactions and validations unlike existing conventional blockchain technology. It offers 3 levels of hashing placed at generator, server and validator ends for data security from data tampering and two levels of encryption for communication lines between generator-server and server-validator for packet security. This system ensures trustworthiness, authenticity, and CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability) to its end users while being real time in execution. The present system does not follow a chain-based _file architecture. Due to this, no concept of chain break arises and the problems that arises as a result of chain break in blockchain are avoided.
